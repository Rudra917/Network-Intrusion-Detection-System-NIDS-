# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-NIDS-
This project focuses on building a machine learning based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The goal is to automatically detect and classify network attacks such as DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R, Using IBM Watson Studio. The system effectively distinguishes between normal and malicious traffic contributing to real-time cybersecurity monitoring.
